Student Grade Generator (Toy Problem)
Write that prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. Then output the correct grade: 

A > 79, B - 60 to 79, C -  59 to 49, D - 40 to 49, E - less 40.
# solution
It contains a HTML button that prompts the user to input their score and outputs the grade. The HTML is linked to the gradeGenerator2.js file that contains the javascript file.


# challenge 2
Speed Detector (Toy Problem)
Write a program that takes as input the speed of a car e.g 80. If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.

For example, if the speed is 80, it should print: “Points: 2”. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print: “License suspended”.
# solution
It contains a function that takes in speed where if speed is greater than 70, then it prints points: plus the division result. If the points exceed 12, the function returns license suspended.


# challenge 3
